A small server for playing Go over the web!

Requires python modules tornado (2.x) and pymongo. These can be installed
by running "pip install tornado" and "pip install pymongo" if you have pip.

Also requires MongoDB to be running. How to install and run this depends 
on your OS.

Run "python server.py" and point your web browser to http://localhost:8890 
to try it.
