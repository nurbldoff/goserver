A small server for playing Go over the web!

Requires the python module Tornado 2.2. 

Relies on websockets to update the board when a move is made, so it probably
won't work in all browsers. Recent Firefox and Chrome versions work.

Run "python server.py" and point your web browser to http://localhost:8888 
to try it.
